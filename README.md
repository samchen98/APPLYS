# APPLYS

About:

Most AYA (Adolescents and Young Adults) with chronic health conditions are not prepared to self-manage their
own health-focused services as they transition from pediatric to adult-focused health services. On the other
hand, most parents of these AYA do not know when to let go of managing their childrenâ€™s health.
Our application APPLYS will be a centralized tool that will allow AYA with chronic health conditions and 
their parents/guardians to take a series of surveys through an app on their phones, and these surveys will 
assess whether or not they are prepared to manage their health services and educate them if needed. 
Other features of the app include medical passports and information pages.
